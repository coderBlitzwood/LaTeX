\subsection{Question}


A single card is removed from a deck of 52 cards. From the remainder we draw 2 cards at random and find that they are both spades. \\
What is the probability that the first card removed was also a spade?

\subsection{General observation}
Given the 'large' number of cards of each suit, we would still expect the answer to be quite close to $\frac{1}{4}$, but slightly lower since one of the possible spades was removed.

\subsection{Answer}
Firstly, we evaluate the probability of drawing 2 spades from the remaining 51 cards, conditioned on the first card. \\
Let $2 \spadesuit$ be the event of drawing 2 spades, $\spadesuit_1$ be the event of the removed card being a spade, and $  !\spadesuit_1$ be the event that the removed card is not a spade. 

\begin{equation*} 
\mathbf{P}(2 \spadesuit)  = \mathbf{P}(2 \spadesuit \mid \spadesuit_1)\times  \mathbf{P}(\spadesuit_1) + 
\mathbf{P}(2 \spadesuit \mid \, !\spadesuit_1)\times  \mathbf{P}(!\spadesuit_1) 
\end{equation*} 
  
\begin{equation*} 
= \left(\frac{12}{51}\right)\left(\frac{11}{50}\right)\times\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + \left(\frac{13}{51}\right) \left(\frac{12}{50}\right)\times\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)
= \frac{33 + 117}{51\times 50} = \frac{1}{17}
\end{equation*} 

From the definition of conditional probability (see \eqref{Formula1.6}) : 
\begin{equation*} 
\mathbf{P} (A \mid B) = \frac{\mathbf{P}(A \cap B)} {\mathbf{P}(B)}  
\end{equation*} 
\begin{equation*} 
\therefore \mathbf{P} (A \mid B) = \mathbf{P} (B \mid A) \times \frac{\mathbf{P}(B)}{\mathbf{P}(A)} \text{   provided } \mathbf{P}(B) > 0 \text{ and } \mathbf{P}(A) > 0
\end{equation*} 

So, \\ 
\begin{equation*} 
\mathbf{P}(\spadesuit_1 \mid 2 \spadesuit) = \mathbf{P}(2 \spadesuit \mid  \spadesuit_1) \times \left(\frac{\mathbf{P}(\spadesuit_1)}{\mathbf{P}(2 \spadesuit)}\right)
 \end{equation*} 
 \begin{equation*} 
= \frac{12}{51} \times \frac{11}{50} \times \frac{1}{4} \div \frac{1}{17} = \frac{12 \times 17 \times 11}{4 \times 51 \times 50} = \frac{11}{50}
 \end{equation*}
