\subsection{Question}

The buses which stop at the end of my road do not keep to the timetable. They should run every quarter hour, at 8:30, 8:45, 9:00 \ldots but in fact each bus is either five minutes early
or five minutes late, the two possibilities being equally likely and the busses independent. \\
Other people arrive at the bus stop in such a way that $t$ minutes after the departure of one bus, the probability that no one is waiting for the next one is $e^\frac{-t}{5}$.\\
(a) What is the probability that no one is waiting at 9:00? \\
(b) One day I come to the bus stop at 9:00 and find no one there; show that the chances are more than four to one that I have missed the nine o'clock bus.
(You may use hthe good approximation $e^3 \approx 20$)

\subsection{Answer to part (a)}

Let $B_{h:mm}$ be the event that a bus arrives at time $h:mm$. \\
There are three possibilities for the times of the most recent bus prior to 9:00, namely : \\
(i) 8:55 - The 9:00 bus was 5 minutes early,\\
(ii) 8:50 - The 8:45 bus was 5 minutes late and the 9:00 bus will be 5 minutes late,\\
(iii) 8:40 - The 8:45 bus was 5 minutes early and the 9:00 bus will be 5 minutes late.\\
 
\begin{multline*} 
\therefore \mathbf{P} (\text{no one is waiting at 9:00}) \\
= \mathbf{P}(B_{8:55})e^{-1} + \mathbf{P}(B_{8:50})\mathbf{P}(B_{9:05})e^{-2} + \mathbf{P}(B_{8:40})\mathbf{P}(B_{9:05})e^{-4} \\
= \frac{1}{4}(2e^{-1} + e^{-2} + e^{-4})
\end{multline*}

\subsection{Answer to part (b)} 
Note that ``missed the nine o'clock bus'' means that the bus must have arrived at 8:55 (with probability $\frac{1}{2}$ ignoring any other constraints).

\begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{l}
\mathbf{P} (B_{8:55} \mid \text{no one is waiting at 9:00}) \\
\qquad = \mathbf{P} (\text{no one is waiting at 9:00} \mid B_{8:55}) \times \frac{\mathbf{P} (B_{8:55})}{\mathbf{P} (\text{no one is waiting at 9:00})}  \\
\qquad = e^{-1} \times \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{ \frac{1}{4}(2e^{-1} + e^{-2} + e^{-4})} = \frac{2e^3}{2e^3+e^2+1} \\
\qquad \approx \frac{40}{49} > \frac{4}{5}  
\end{IEEEeqnarray*}
